## 💭 vision

to create an ai-enhanced hiking assistant that empowers safer, more intuitive, more connected experiences in nature — for both humans *and* their furry sidekicks.

imagine hiking with a guide who:
- hears what you can't
- sees what’s ahead
- knows your vibe
- and sends you the best trail with the fewest loud bluetooth speakers 😅
